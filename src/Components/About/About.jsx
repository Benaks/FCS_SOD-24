              This year{"'"}s SOD 2025 program is dedicated to nurturing
              believers with the wisdom and life of God, enabling them to
              represent Him effectively in this world. As disciples of Christ,
              we understand that while we live in this world, <br />
              <br /> we are not of it. This truth shapes our belief that
              anything derived solely from this world—be it culture, mindsets,
              systems, ideologies, beliefs, or principles—cannot be our
              standard. Instead, we follow the divine blueprint for holy living
              given by God. Our core principle is rooted in the words of Jesus:{" "}
              {'"'}Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
              proceeds from the mouth of God{'"'} (Matthew 4:4). <br />
              The Word of God is the foundation of all creation, guiding our
              actions and decisions to ensure we live in a way that honors Him.
              From an early age, we are taught the importance of the Holy
              Scriptures, as stated in 2 Timothy 3:15-17: {'"'}And that from
              childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to
              make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ
              Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
              profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
              instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete,
              thoroughly equipped for every good work.{'"'} The mission of SOD
              2024 is to thoroughly equip believers with God{"'"}s Word. <br />{" "}
              We address various aspects of life, including purpose, ensuring
              that each believer is ready to manifest God{"'"}s wisdom and life
              in every situation. This mission is carried out under the guidance
              and empowerment of the Holy Spirit. Join us in SOD 2025 as we
              embark on a journey of spiritual growth and empowerment. <br />{" "}
              Together, we will explore the depths of God’s Word, aiming to
              understand and apply its truths to our lives. Welcome to a
              transformative program where we endeavor to reflect the wisdom and
              life of God in all that we do.
