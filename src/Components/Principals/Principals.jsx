              In as much as we walk in this world, we are not of this world, and
              by implication that means anything that finds it's origin or
              source in this world alone is not a standard by which we as
              believers should live, be it culture,mindsets, systems,
              ideologies, beliefs, principles- if it is not in accordance with
              the designated template for holy living, then it against God and
              Godliness. <br /> <br /> God however did not live us in the dark
              as to how we ought to live and where we can find this instructions
              for Godly living-"man shall not live by bread alone but by EVERY
              WORD THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD".(Mathew 4:4)- his very
              own word, without which nothing that was made would have been made
              is that designated template that guides our actions and decisions
              to ensure our effective representation of him in this world. "And
              that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are
              able to make you WISE for salvation through faith which is in
              Christ Jesus. <br />
              <br /> All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,
              and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
              instruction in righteousness, THAT THE MAN OF GOD MAY BE COMPLETE,
              THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED FOR EVERY GOOD WORK".(2 Timothy 3:15-17)-
              Thorough equipping by the Word of God is what we seek to do in
              this years SOD, regarding things pertaining to God and the
              believer and different areas of living, including purpose unto the
              end that the believer manifests the wisdom and life of God
              wherever he or she is found, and this we would do by the Help of
              the Holy Ghost. <br /> WELCOME TO SOD 2024 . <br />
